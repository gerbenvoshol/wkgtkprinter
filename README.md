# wkgtkprinter
HTML to PDF conversion library (with one simple function) using WebkitGtk (similar to wkhtmltopdf, but without the Qt part).

A simple snippet (glue code) written in C to demonstrate the conversion process of HTML to PDF using Gtk+ and WebkitGtk.

You can use this code to generate invoices from command line or from your software. you can use it from any programming language using libffi.

Very minimalistic code, and easy to embed and understand.
