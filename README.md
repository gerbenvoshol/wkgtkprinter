# wkgtkprinter
HTML to PDF converter using WebkitGtk (similar to wkhtmltopdf, but without the Qt part).

A simple snippet written in C to demonstrate the conversion process of HTML to PDF.

You can use this code to generate invoices from command line or from your software.

Very minimalistic code, and easy to embed and understand.
